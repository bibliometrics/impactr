relative_citation
_ratio
The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) indicates the relative citation
performance of an article when comparing its citation rate to that of
other articles in its area of research. A value of more than 1.0 shows a
citation rate above average. The article’s area of research is defined by
the articles that have been cited alongside it. The RCR is calculated for
all PubMed publications which are at least 2 years old.


Field_citation
_ratio
The Field Citation Ratio (FCR) is an article-level metric that indicates the
relative citation performance of an article, when compared to
similarly-aged articles in its subject area. A value of more than 1.0
indicates higher than average citation, when defined by FoR Subject
Code, publishing year and age. The FCR is calculated for all publications
in Dimensions which are at least 2 years old and were published in 2000
or later

recent_citations The recent citations value is the number of citations that were received in
the last two years. The citation date used in the calculations rolls over in
the middle of the year. For example in 2019 the calculation looks at
citations from 2017 for the months of 2019-01 till 2019-06 and switches
to citations from 2018 from 2019-07 onwards.



times_cited ‘Times cited’ indicates the number of times a publication was cited by
other publications. We count citations from the reference list in all
publications that are indexed in Dimensions. Times_cited is for all years
